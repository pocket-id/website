### Setup

1. Install the dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
2. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

This command starts a local development server and opens up a browser window. Most changes are reflected live without having to restart the server.

### Structure
The markdown files are located in the `docs` folder. The sidebar is defined in `sidebars.ts`.
