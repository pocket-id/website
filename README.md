### Setup

1. Install the dependencies:
   ```bash
   pnpm install
   ```
2. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   pnpm dev
   ```

This command starts a local development server and opens up a browser window. Most changes are reflected live without having to restart the server.

### Structure

The markdown files are located in the `docs` folder and The Sidebar is configured via `src/lib/config/docs.ts`.
