# Cloudflare Zero Trust

**Note: Cloudflare will need to be able to reach your Pocket ID instance and vice versa for this to work correctly**

## Pocket ID Setup

1. In Pocket-ID create a new OIDC Client, name it i.e. `Cloudflare Zero Trust`.
2. Set a logo for this OIDC Client if you would like too.
3. Set the callback URL to: `https://<your-team-name>.cloudflareaccess.com/cdn-cgi/access/callback`.
4. Copy the Client ID, Client Secret, Authorization URL, Token URL, and Certificate URL for the next steps.
