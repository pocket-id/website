# LDAP Synchronization

Pocket ID can sync users and groups from an LDAP Source (lldap, OpenLDAP, Active Directory, etc.).

### LDAP Sync

- The LDAP Service will sync on Pocket ID startup and every hour once enabled from the Web UI.
- Users or groups synced from LDAP can **NOT** be edited from the Pocket ID Web UI.

### Generic LDAP Setup

1. Follow the installation guide [here](/docs/setup/installation).
2. Once you have signed in with the initial admin account, navigate to the Application Configuration section at `https://pocket.id/settings/admin/application-configuration`.
