# Translating

Help us make Pocket ID accessible in your language by contributing translations.

## Translation Guidelines

- Use informal language for translations

## Getting Started

1. Visit our [Crowdin project page](https://crowdin.com/project/pocket-id).
2. Choose the language you wish to translate into.
3. Open the `en-US.json` source file.
4. Now you can start translating the strings.

## Adding a New Language

Is your language missing from Crowdin? You can [request its addition](https://github.com/pocket-id/pocket-id/issues/new?assignees=&labels=language-request&projects=&template=language-request.yml&title=%F0%9F%8C%90+Language+request%3A+%3Clanguage+name+in+english%3E).
